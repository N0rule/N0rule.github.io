          <h2>3D Models</h2>
          <p>I've always been fascinated by the potential of virtual reality and the immersive experiences it offers.
            That's why I jumped into the world of VRChat, a popular social VR platform where users can create and
            share their own content.
            <br><br>One of my first projects in VRChat was creating a series of custom avatars for users to use. I
            aimed to create a diverse range of styles and themes, from fantasy characters to anime-inspired designs. I
            put a lot of effort into the details of each model, making sure they were both unique and of high quality.
            <br><br>Apart from VRChat avatars, I also enjoy creating 3D models for game development. I have worked on
            several game projects in the past, creating characters, props, and environments for various game genres.
            It's incredibly rewarding to see my models come to life in a game and be enjoyed by players.
            <br><br>All my 3D models are created using Blender. I continuously improve my skills by learning new
            techniques and experimenting with materials and lighting.

          <h2>Games</h2>
          <p>Presenting "Zombie Shooter", a survival game developed using Unity. Players are challenged to fend off
            waves of zombies with a selection of weapons, including a pistol, shotgun, rifle, and sniper rifle. Each
            weapon possesses its own unique feature, adding a new dimension of strategy and thrill to the gameplay
            experience.
            <br><br>
            For instance, the pistol is ideal for dispatching zombies at close range, while the shotgun excels at
            taking out large groups of enemies. The rifle, equipped with a laser for improved accuracy, can be
            utilized both in close and long-range battles. The sniper rifle, on the other hand, provides players with
            a safe means of eliminating zombies from a distance.
            <br><br>
            In addition to weapons, players have access to a range of items, such as health packs and ammunition, to
            enhance their chances of survival.

          <h2>Cloud Hosting Solutions</h2>
          <p>I've had the privilege of utilizing Oracle Cloud for hosting various projects. One of my most notable
            achievements has been the establishment and management of a Discord bot and a Minecraft server.<br><br>
            To set up the Discord bot, I created a virtual machine on Oracle Cloud and installed the necessary
            software and dependencies. I then configured the bot's settings to cater to the specific needs of my
            community, and set up a MongoDB database to store user information and other data for the bot.<br><br>
            I also established a Minecraft Purpur server using Oracle Cloud. This involved creating a virtual machine,
            installing the necessary software and dependencies, and configuring the server settings to match the needs
            of my community. Additionally, I installed various plugins to improve the gameplay experience for my
            players. Hosting the Minecraft server on Oracle Cloud provided a valuable learning experience, as it
            showcased the platform's flexibility and scalability.
