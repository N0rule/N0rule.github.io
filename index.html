            <h2>3D Models</h2>
            <p>I have always been fascinated by the possibilities of virtual reality and the immersive
              experiences it can provide. That's why I decided to dive into the world of VRChat, a popular social VR
              platform where users can create and share their own content.<br><br>
              One of my first projects in VRChat was creating a series of custom avatars for players to use. I wanted to
              create a variety of different styles and themes, from fantasy characters to anime-inspired designs. I put
              a lot of time and effort into the details of each model, making sure they were both unique and
              high-quality. <br><br>
              In addition to creating avatars for VRChat, I also enjoy creating 3D models for game development. I have
              worked on several game projects in the past, creating characters, props, and environments for different
              genres of games. I find it extremely rewarding to see my models come to life in a game and be enjoyed by
              players.<br><br>
              All of my 3D models are created using Blender. I am
              constantly learning new techniques and experimenting with different materials and lighting to improve my
              skills.

            <h2>Games</h2>
            <p>Introducing "Zombie Shooter", survival game created using Unity. In this game, players are
              tasked with fighting off hordes of zombies using a variety of weapons, including a pistol, shotgun, rifle,
              and sniper rifle. Each weapon has its own unique gimmick, adding an extra layer of strategy and excitement
              to the gameplay.<br><br>
              Pistol, for example, is perfect for taking out zombies at close range, while the shotgun is ideal for
              clearing out large groups of enemies. The rifle has laser to help with aim, and can be used in both close
              and long-range combat, sniper rifle allows players to take out zombies from a safe distance. <br><br>
              In addition to the weapons, players can also use various items, such as health packs and ammo, to aid in
              their survival.</p>

            <h2>Cloud Hosting </h2>
            <p>I have had the opportunity to work with Oracle Cloud to host a variety of projects. One of my most
              successful endeavors has been the setup and maintenance of a Discord bot and Minecraft server.<br><br>
              The process of setting up the Discord bot involved creating a virtual machine on Oracle Cloud, installing
              the necessary software and dependencies, and configuring the bot's settings to meet the specific needs of
              my community. I also set up a MongoDB database to store user information and other data for the
              bot.<br><br>
              In addition to the bot, I have also set up a Minecraft Purpur server using Oracle Cloud. This involved
              creating a
              virtual machine, installing the necessary software and dependencies, and configuring the server settings
              to match the needs of my community. I also implemented a variety of plugins to enhance the gameplay
              experience for my players. This experience of hosting Minecraft server using Oracle Cloud was a great
              learning opportunity for me, as it allowed me to understand the flexibility and scalability of the
              platform.
